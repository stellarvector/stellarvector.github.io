Join us for an inspiring evening at Young Inspires Experienced, where we explore the world of cybersecurity through the eyes of professionals who live and breathe it.

Our speakers:

- Angelos Beitis – PhD student at KU Leuven, winner of a Pwnie Award (Most Innovative Research) for his groundbreaking work in cybersecurity.
- Thomas Hayen – Team Lead of Penetration Testing & Red Teaming at Easi, and lecturer at Thomas More.
- Mickey De Baets – Red Teamer for the financial sector and teacher, passionate about bridging real-world threats and education.

They'll share:

- What drives them to work in cybersecurity
- Why they love doing what they do
- And even some technical deep dives into their work 

After the talks, stick around for drinks and informal conversation – a perfect chance to connect, ask questions, or just chat with like-minded people 

Whether you're a student, tech enthusiast, or just curious about hacking and defense – this is your chance to learn, connect, and get inspired.

Participation is free, registration is required.
