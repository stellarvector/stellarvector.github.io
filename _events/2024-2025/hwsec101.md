On Wednesday the **23rd of April 2025** at **20h**, **Stellar Vector** will organize HWSec101, in which we'll introduce you in the world of hardware security.

You will get some info on the field of hardware security from experts from [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) and then you'll be able to dive in and get some practical experience with the introduced attacks on a real hardware device.
There will be challenges for beginners and also some extra tasks for more experienced participants.

You **don't need any experience** in hardware security in order to participate, we are all there to learn!
Joining is free, but registration is required. Please do so using [this form]({{ page.signup }}).
**Spaces are limited due to limited hardware availability, so sign up quickly**
